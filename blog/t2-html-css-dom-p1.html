    <h5> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h5>
    <p>Imagine you are writing a document in word. HTML is the language you are using to write the document like English, Spanish etc. CSS is the visual elements you are adding to the document like bold text, text font, colour etc. and the DOM is the complete structure of the document like heading, sub heading, paragraph, bullet points etc.</p>
