    <h1>HTML CSS and DOM</h1>
   
    <h2> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are writing a document in word. HTML is the language you are using to write the document like English, Spanish etc. CSS is the visual elements you are adding to the document like bold text, text font, colour etc. and the DOM is the complete structure of the document like heading, sub heading, paragraph, bullet points etc.</p>

    <h2> What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
    <p>Boxifying is a logical concept that everything that is on the webpage is a set of boxes.So, everything on the page can be broken down into small boxes.
        In the same way, everything on the webpage can be built putting together small boxes. </p>

    <h2> What is the box model?</h2>
    <p>As per the concept of Boxifying, box model is indepth understanding of what each box properties are like content in the middle, with padding on the top and border around the padding with margin around the border. margin is nothing but the space between two boxes.</p>
