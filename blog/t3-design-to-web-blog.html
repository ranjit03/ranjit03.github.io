    <h5> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</h5>
    <p>Responsive site is adjusting layout and content dynamically to different screen sizes. It is very imporatnt due to diversity in screen sizes used in the 
        market. This makes the sire readable and user friendly irrespective of the devices it is accessed from. Also, it eliminates the need of having multiple webistes to suit multiple screen sizes </p>

    <h5>  What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</h5>
    <p>Mobile first design is designing a site to mobile first. Designing it to small size screen is important as most imporatnt elements and simple design can be made to fit small screen 
        and then as we go to bigger screens, we can add complex things.
    </p>

    <h5>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</h5>
    <p>Frameworks are a collection of classes already built. These can be used in projects that we build.Advantage of framework is they make it easier to build certain aspects of your 
        projects. They save a lot of time. Disadvantages are they might not be of much help for simple projects.Sites might take longer to load unncecessary code that come with framework and
    that is not needed on our site.They might not provide full functionality our site needs, so we might have to write our own code.  </p>
    
    <h5>   What a wireframe is and why we use it.</h5>
    <p>Wireframe is designing webiste in boxes.Planning the positions of content and images using boxes. We use wireframe design to convert to actual design by treating every box as a class.
        We use it easily built and manage site.

    <h5>The aspects of your wireframes you found difficult to implement, and why</h5>
    <p> I didn't find anything that was too complicated but I found images and one third blocks a bit difficult.
        Also, I found resposive website wasn't working when ckecked on mobile but I fixed it by adding meta tag.
