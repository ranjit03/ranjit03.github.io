    <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h5>
    <p>By practising process over product throughout my study made me concentrate on learning than worrying about end product.I felt this is very important element to keep in mind during initial
      stages of learning as it boosts your confidence making you realise that you are learning something irrespective of the end product.   </p>

    <h5> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h5>
    <p>Before reading chapter 2, I thought meditation is all about eyes closed and keeping yourself calm.</p>
    
    <h5> What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h5>
    <p>Meditation is all about settling your mind. Brining attention to your breath and not reacting to situations. It's all about brining attention back smoothly when it wanders away.
    </p>
    
    <h5> Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h5>
    <p>Definitely bringing attention to breath and deciding on the posture that is comfortable to you are the suggestions that stood out. </p>
