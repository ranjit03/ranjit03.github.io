<h1>Technical Blog 4</h1>
<h3>Got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
<p>Honestly I don't think I have done enough training on basics yet as I get stuck with syntac errors and not declaring simple things leading to complete 
    code not working. I do realize that this is a process of continous development and learning new things from mistakes is what we are aiming for.
    There is nothing like an end to this study and I am determined to continue without a doubt.For these simple problems, there is no special problem solving technics as 
    going through code over and over again will make you spot the error.</p>
<h3>Solved a problem in an elegant way.</h3>
<p>In the kata challenges, I wasn't able to complete all but the ones I have completed are solved in a elegant way as most of them were solved through pseudocode and google. </p>
<h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process</h3>
<ul>
<li>Pseudocode.</li><p>Very confident and its my favourite.</p>
<li>Trying something.</li><p>I don't mind and I am comfortable.</p>
<li>Rubber ducky method.</li><p>Not great at this, at this stage.</p>
<li>Reading error messages.</li><p>I am aware of the power of this.</p>
<li>Console.logging</li><p>My go to. </p>
<li>Googling.</li><p>If google doesn't, no one else does.</p>
<li>Asking your peers for help.</li><p>I am getting better at it.</p>
<li>Asking coaches for help.</li><p>I will start practising.</p>
<li>Improving your process with reflection.</li><p>Best tool for self discipline and improvement.</p>
</ul>
