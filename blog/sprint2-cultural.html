<h1>Learning Agreement</h1>
<h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations</h3>
<p>Strengths are techncial knowledge, problem solving skills, hard work and commitment. Limitations are time management and having to commit to too many things than I could handle.</p>
<h3>Based on the above description, a commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives.</h3>
<p>I have decided not to postpone work to end of deadlines. I have decided on set times to work on coding every single day and sticking to the schedule is my goal.</p>
<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
<p>Approach facilitators and cohort for help and also helping them with queries in the same way.</p>
<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
<p>Support for a successful learning environment.</p>
<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.
These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.</h3>
<p>I have quite a few things planned in the next few months and having to plan and commit to those plans are very important. I have time scheduled 
    for everyday coding and I am committed to sticking to the schedule.
