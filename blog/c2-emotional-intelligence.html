      <h5>Emotional Intelligence</h5>
   
    <h5>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h5>
    <p>I appreciate Meng's desire to bring global peace and how emotional intelligence is a tool to partially reach the goal.
        Emotional intelligence is something that can be practised and can become an involuntary action in someone's life.
        I like the concept of mindfulness, attention, controlling emotions and emapthy to bring happiness in and around us.
I have strongly decided to practice this and pass on the message to people around us.
I also feel, being liked in workplace is a great asset to be successful and controlling emotions and self awareness adds even more to our success.</p>

    <h5>  How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h5>
    <p>Mindfullness is a great concept and it's practical effects amazed me.I started practising it and even though it's only two minutes of your day, it takes time to get a hang of it. It's not as easy as I thought but I started practising it and using the app 
        <a href= "https://www.headspace.com/">headspace</a> made the experience a lot easier and better. I started the concept of concentrating on breath for two minutes at the same time of the day everyday.
