    <h5>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h5>
    <p>Mindfulness conversation made me grasp more from the interaction and it made me feel importaance of that particular moment. Other person found that they have got a lot more attention.

    <h5>  Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?        </h5>
    <p>I will be doing atleast one mindful breath a day.</p>
    
    <h5> Any other musings?</h5>
