<h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
<p>The skill of being aware of and controlling one's own emotions is called emotional intelligence.Ability to understand the state of mind like if it 
  is present in the moment or if it has wandered off and ability to bring it back to present state.Developing emotional intelligence makes great leaders and
team players as they have full control over their emotions. </p>
<h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
<p>IQ is a score derived from a test to assess intelligence and it is based on ability to learn, understand and clear challenges.</p>
<h3>Why is it important?</h3>
<p>Emotional intelligence has become a far more important indicator of success as a team player, leader and ability to work on your own.
  These days it's not about being intelligent by birth as technology keeps changing at a rapid rate and eveyone has to start learning at some stage and 
  keep up with the crowd and this ability to learn and develop as a team is vastly dependant on emotional intelligence.
