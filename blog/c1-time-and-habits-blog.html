    <h1>My reflections on "Time and Habit techniques"</h1>
   
    <h2>which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h2>
    <p>Only thing I have tried yet is Toggl and it's interesting to know how your time is spent.
     I would like to implement Scrum framework throughout my Phase 0 having specific deadlines to specific sprints and up on completion, reflecting on the work done and having self feedback on what can be made better.
     Implementing these feedback on next sprints.</p>

    <h2> what did you find interesting?</h2>
    <p>Interesting to know the effects of meditation and scientific explanantion behind it.
    It's so true that tiny habits that were implemented long time ago are long lasting, almost an entire life.</p>

    <h2> what worked for you?</h2>
    <p>Up on self evaluation, tiny habbits developed over time are long lasting almost life time even without knowing.</p>
    
    <h2> which will you experiment further with?</h2>
    <p>I will try meditation and also anything that is hard to start, I will try to start small and then grow further in small bits.</p>
