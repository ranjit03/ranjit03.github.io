    <h1>My reflections on "Shereef's Fireside Chat"</h1>
   
    <h2>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h2>
    <p>After going through a lot of material on what EDA is and how it is different to traditional eduaction out there. I strongly 
      feel that is how the education should be and it's a great example with it's success out there with succesful graduates. 
    </p>

    <h2> What are your impressions?</h2>
    <p>Shereef explains clearly with amazing examples that this is just not a platform to buy success readymade  but a place to experiment with what's on the table and learn to be a better and successful person.He realtes very well with his restaurant and kitchen example. Also, with his example of tennis and soccer, he clearly relates  a great developer is fromed not just by writng great code himself but being a great human being able to work well within a team with empathy, kindness and open to feedback.</p>

    <h2> How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h2>
    <p>I am excited to engage with this type of culture.It's positive and it brings you happiness and success. I haven't had a complete experience of this culture before but I always had a really good feel for this kind of culture.I always believe in positive human interations and they are a great path for success in business.</p>
    
    <h2> Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h2>
    <p>My expectaions of EDA hasn't changed at all. I had great expections and this reinforced it.</p> 

    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>
    <p>I am excited to participate and strongly want to change and make a career. It does make me nervous but I understand success doesn't come in to your comfort zone. You need to get out and get it and I am ready for it.</p>
