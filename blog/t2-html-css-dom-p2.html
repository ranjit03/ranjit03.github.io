      <h5> What is grid based design?</h5>
      <p>In alignment with boxifying concept, complete webpage is divided into rows and columns. 
          Each row then can be subdivided into 12 columns. Mix of a part of row and column will form a box and each box is a class.</p>
  
      <h5>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h5>
      <p>It's a great concept to create great experience for the user with so much advancements in technology and varied user base with different screen sizes from 
          desktops, laptops, tablets to mobile phones. Responsive webpages are a way of keeping the webpage readable and attractive in transition between different screen sizes. </p>
  
      <h5> What is semantic structure?</h5>
      <p>Semantic structure is not about the look of the content but the importance of the content.Like the h1 tag superior to all other h tags. </p>
      
      <h5> Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</h5>
      <p>I really liked the concept of building your own framework or using a famous framework like bootstrap.
           A project can be a combination of frameworks with a framework of your own. Also getting to know the very basics of building framewok,
           not just building things from classes defined in a famous framework. </p>
