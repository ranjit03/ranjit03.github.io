<h3>Neuroplaticity</h3>
<p>Neuroplasticity is the ability of brain to evolve and change with the way we live. This clears the myth that people need to be born intelligent 
    and the brain need to be better at birth to be smart.This explains that brain gets adjusted and learns with the way of live we live and it is 
    possible to become smart with proper training of brain.Examples such as piano training without touching piano gives me a lot of confidence to train brain 
    and reap it's benefits.</p>
<h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
<p>This slams on the traditional grading and appreciation system which is not relevant in the present society. This has been explained well with scientific 
    study and developing "Yet" attitude keeps us motivated to reach new levels everyday. Insecurity feeling towards losing, having settled and intimidated 
    by failure is a biggest hurdle in success and practising growth and yet mindset helps you overcome it.
